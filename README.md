## Getting Started
To install dependencies:

You can use `.env` to set your Port and other environment variables.
```ini
PORT=5000
```

PORT by default is set to `3000`.

To run:

```bash
bun start
bun start:dev # for development
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.1. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
